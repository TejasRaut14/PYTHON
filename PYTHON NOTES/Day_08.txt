The load function takes a file object reconstruct the objects from pickle representaion and retturn it


JSON IN PYTHON :

   1]javascript object notation
   2]mainly used for storing and transfering data between the broweser and server
   3]JSON is text written with javascript object notation
   4]python to support JSON with a built in package called JSON

   JSON support mainly 6 data types:
   
   string 
   number
   boolean
   null
   object
   array
   
   converting python objects to JSOn:
   
   blog={'URL':'www.goggle.com','name':'tejas'}
   
   to_json=json.dumps(blog)
   
Converting JSON to python Objects:

Writting and Reading JSON file:

Reading and writting JSON file:

import json 
file=open("posts.json","r")
finaldata=file.read()
finaldata=json.loads(x)
